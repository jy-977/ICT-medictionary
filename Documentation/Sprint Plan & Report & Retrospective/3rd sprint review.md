[DESCRIPTION GOES HERE]
For this 3nd sprint, We have done our best to keep updating the kanban more often. Although, we needed to be sure that every task would be correctly performed so it doesn't seem like the ideal burndown graph but it's performed better than previous sprint.
In conclusion, we will try to follow the project progress more regularly next time.
